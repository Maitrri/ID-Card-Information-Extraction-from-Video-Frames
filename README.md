# ID Card Information Extraction from Video Frames  

This project automates the extraction of ID card information, such as name, date of birth, and contact details, from specific frame ranges in a video file. Leveraging OpenCV for video frame processing and Tesseract OCR for text recognition, it simplifies tasks like identity verification and data entry. By incorporating Matplotlib for visual validation, the system enhances the accuracy and efficiency of automated document processing.
